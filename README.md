Hi, I am [Aarsh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/Aarsh), from [Atlanta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta). [Computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_master%27s_degrees_in_North_America#Computer_Science), [Coffee connoisseur](https://www.urbandictionary.com/tags.php?tag=coffee%20connoisseur), [Hiker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking) and, a [foodie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodie). Artificial Intelligence developer by profession. I have been a developer since 2011. Worked in different industries with companies of all shapes and sizes. [Published](https://wildclick.wordpress.com/category/published/) a couple of books on-line and several open-source software utilities. I have researched with [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov), MIT, Google, NASA in the AI arena. In my spare (?) time, I like to work on my pet projects using Raspberry Pi. AI, Machine Learning, IoT, Computational Photography and Embedded software intrigue me. Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degrees in Computer Science, with a specialization in [Interactive intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/masters/computer-science/specializations) and a [Microsoft Certified Professional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Certified_Professional). I have been running a [Linux Users Group](https://sites.google.com/view/fossusersgroup/home) (LUG) since, 2007.

I enjoy Photography. My goal is to combine photography and computation, in other words combining the art and science of images. e.g. [Dual Photography](http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/dual_photography/)
